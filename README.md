# Excel & Spreadsheet Lookup Functions, Pivot, and Chart Exercises

## Project Description
This project contains exercises to practice essential **lookup functions** and **charting techniques** in Microsoft Excel and other spreadsheet tools. It is designed to help users learn and apply common lookup formulas and data visualization tools for analysis and reporting tasks.

## Functions and Features Practiced

### Lookup Functions:
- **VLOOKUP**: Searches for a value in the first column of a table and returns a value in the same row from another column.
- **HLOOKUP**: Searches for a value in the first row of a table and returns a value in the same column from another row.
- **INDEX-MATCH**: A powerful combination of functions for flexible lookup operations, often used as an alternative to VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP.

### Charts & Visualizations:
- **PIE CHART**: Displays proportions of categories as slices of a pie.
- **BAR CHART**: Compares values across categories using horizontal or vertical bars.
- **LINE CHART**: Shows trends over time or categories through connected data points.
- **SCATTER PLOT**: Displays relationships between two numerical variables through points on an X-Y graph.
- **GEO MAP**: Visualizes geographical data on a map (available in modern Excel versions or Google Sheets).

## Objective
By completing this project, users will:
- Understand and apply essential lookup functions for data retrieval.
- Create basic visualizations to communicate data insights clearly.
- Improve spreadsheet analysis skills for both academic and professional use.
